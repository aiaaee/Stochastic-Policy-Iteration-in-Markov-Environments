# Policy Iteration in a Stochastic Environment
This project implements policy iteration in a stochastic environment using policy evaluation and policy improvement. It demonstrates how an agent can iteratively improve its strategy to maximize expected rewards in uncertain settings.

This repository contains a Python implementation of **Policy Iteration** applied to the `FrozenLake-v1` environment from OpenAI Gym. The project focuses on evaluating and improving two types of policies:

1. **Go-Get Policy**  
2. **Careful Policy**

The main goal is to analyze how different policies perform in terms of reaching the goal state under a stochastic environment.
